## üîÑ Pipeline Overview

### GitHub Actions Workflow
The AMOSKYS platform uses GitHub Actions for automated:
- **Multi-version testing** across Python 3.11, 3.12, and 3.13
- **Security scanning** with industry-standard tools
- **Code quality enforcement** with automated formatting and linting
- **Dependency management** with vulnerability detection
- **Automated documentation** generation and validation

### Pipeline Triggers
- **Push to main/develop**: Full pipeline execution
- **Pull requests**: Code quality and security checks
- **Scheduled runs**: Weekly dependency and security audits
- **Manual triggers**: On-demand pipeline execution

- Write tests for all new features
- Maintain >80% test coverage
- Follow established style guidelines
- Use type hints consistently

### Security
- Never commit secrets or credentials
- Keep dependencies updated
- Run security scans regularly
- Follow secure coding practices

### CI/CD
- Keep pipelines fast and reliable
- Use appropriate caching strategies
- Monitor pipeline performance
- Provide clear failure messages

---

## üß† Neural Command Integration

The AMOSKYS CI/CD pipeline is designed to support the neural command architecture:

- **Adaptive Learning**: Pipeline learns from failures and optimizes
- **Intelligence Integration**: AI-powered test generation and optimization
- **Security Neural Networks**: Advanced threat detection in CI/CD
- **Command Verification**: Neural validation of deployment commands

*The pipeline serves as the nervous system of AMOSKYS - ensuring that every code change maintains the platform's intelligence and security posture.*

---

## üìû Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Test timeouts**: Increase timeout values or optimize tests
- **Dependency conflicts**: Use dependency resolution tools
- **Security false positives**: Add suppressions with justification
- **Performance degradation**: Profile and optimize bottlenecks

### Getting Help
- Check pipeline logs in GitHub Actions
- Review error messages and stack traces
- Consult team documentation
- Escalate to platform team if needed

The AMOSKYS CI/CD pipeline ensures that the neural security platform maintains its high standards of quality, security, and performance with every change.
