# Amoskys Testing Philosophy & Coverage

**Purpose**: Comprehensive testing strategy ensuring reliability, security, and performance at scale.

## 🎯 Testing Philosophy

Amoskys follows a **defense-in-depth testing approach** with multiple layers of validation:

### Core Testing Principles

1. **Security First**: Every security mechanism must be tested
2. **Performance Validation**: Load testing and backpressure handling
3. **Resilience Testing**: Failure scenarios and recovery
4. **Isolation**: Tests must not interfere with each other
5. **Deterministic**: Reproducible results across environments

## 🧪 Test Suite Breakdown

### 1. Unit Tests (`tests/unit/`)

#### 1.1 Jitter Testing (`test_jitter.py`)
**Purpose**: Validate retry backoff behavior and timing.

```python
def test_sleep_with_jitter_bounds():
    """Test jitter stays within expected bounds"""
    base_delay = 1.0
    jitter_factor = 0.1
    
    for _ in range(100):
        actual_delay = sleep_with_jitter(base_delay, jitter_factor)
        assert 0.9 <= actual_delay <= 1.1  # Within 10% jitter
        
def test_sleep_with_jitter_floor():
    """Test minimum delay enforcement"""
    actual_delay = sleep_with_jitter(0.001, 0.1)
    assert actual_delay >= 0.001  # Respects minimum
```

**What it validates**:
- ✅ Retry delays have proper randomization
- ✅ Backoff algorithms work correctly
- ✅ No deterministic retry patterns (security)

#### 1.2 WAL SQLite Testing (`test_wal_sqlite.py`)
**Purpose**: Validate write-ahead log functionality and data durability.

```python
def test_dedup_and_drain_ok(tmp_path):
    """Test WAL deduplication and draining"""
    wal = SQLiteWAL(tmp_path / "test.db")
    
    # Store same event twice
    env1 = make_env(idem="key1")
    env2 = make_env(idem="key1")  # Same key
    
    assert wal.store(env1) == True
    assert wal.store(env2) == True  # Should succeed but not duplicate
    
    # Drain should return only one event
    events = wal.drain(limit=10)
    assert len(events) == 1
    assert events[0].idempotency_key == "key1"

def test_retry_stops_then_ok_continues(tmp_path):
    """Test WAL behavior during retry failures"""
    wal = SQLiteWAL(tmp_path / "test.db")
    
    # Store events
    for i in range(5):
        env = make_env(idem=f"key{i}")
        wal.store(env)
    
    # Mark some as sent
    wal.mark_sent(["key0", "key1"])
    
    # Drain should only return unsent events
    events = wal.drain(limit=10)
    assert len(events) == 3
    assert all(e.idempotency_key not in ["key0", "key1"] for e in events)

def test_backlog_cap_drops_oldest(tmp_path):
    """Test WAL backlog management"""
    wal = SQLiteWAL(tmp_path / "test.db", max_backlog=3)
    
    # Store more events than backlog limit
    for i in range(5):
        env = make_env(idem=f"key{i}")
        wal.store(env)
    
    # Should only keep newest 3 events
    events = wal.drain(limit=10)
    assert len(events) == 3
    assert events[0].idempotency_key == "key2"  # Oldest kept
```

**What it validates**:

    bus_process = start_eventbus(env)
    
    # Send concurrent requests
    with mtls_channel() as ch:
        stub = pbrpc.EventBusStub(ch)
        
        # Send first request (should succeed)
        response1 = stub.Publish(make_valid_env())
        assert response1.status == pb.PublishAck.OK
        
        # Check metrics increased
        metrics = get_prometheus_metrics()
        assert "bus_inflight_requests 1" in metrics
        
        # Send second request while first is processing
        response2 = stub.Publish(make_valid_env())
        assert response2.status == pb.PublishAck.RETRY  # Over limit
        
        # Metrics should show overload

```

**What it validates**:
- ✅ Inflight request tracking is accurate
- ✅ Overload protection works correctly

def test_publish_invalid_missing_fields(bus_process):
    """Test validation of malformed messages"""
    with mtls_channel() as ch:
        stub = pbrpc.EventBusStub(ch)
        
        # Create envelope with missing required fields
        env = pb.Envelope()
        env.version = "v1"
        # Missing: ts_ns, idempotency_key, flow
        
        # Should reject as invalid
        response = stub.Publish(env, timeout=5.0)
        assert response.status == pb.PublishAck.INVALID

    with mtls_channel(port=50052) as ch:  # Custom port for isolation
        stub = pbrpc.EventBusStub(ch)
        
        # Send request to overloaded server
        env = make_valid_env()
        response = stub.Publish(env, timeout=3.0)
        
        # Should receive RETRY response
        assert response.status == pb.PublishAck.RETRY
        assert "overload" in response.reason.lower()
        assert response.backoff_hint_ms >= 0
```

**What it validates**:

    # Start overloaded EventBus
    bus = start_eventbus({"BUS_OVERLOAD": "1"})
    agent = start_agent()
    
    # Wait for agent to build up WAL backlog
    time.sleep(2.0)
    
    # Check WAL has pending events
    with mtls_channel() as ch:
        stub = pbrpc.EventBusStub(ch)
        
        # All publishes should get RETRY
        for _ in range(5):
            env = make_env()
            response = stub.Publish(env)
            assert response.status == pb.PublishAck.RETRY
    
    # Recovery: disable overload
    restart_eventbus({"BUS_OVERLOAD": "0"})
    
    # WAL should drain successfully

    with mtls_channel() as ch:
        stub = pbrpc.EventBusStub(ch)
        
        # Measure 100 request latencies
        for _ in range(100):
            start_time = time.time()
            
            response = stub.Publish(make_valid_env())
            assert response.status == pb.PublishAck.OK
            
            latency_ms = (time.time() - start_time) * 1000
            latencies.append(latency_ms)
    
    # Validate SLA requirements
    p95_latency = np.percentile(latencies, 95)
    assert p95_latency < 100.0  # 95th percentile under 100ms
    
    p99_latency = np.percentile(latencies, 99)

        flags=0
    )
    
    envelope = pb.Envelope(

        ts_ns=1609459200000000000,
        idempotency_key="test-key-123",
        flow=flow,
        sig=b"test-signature",
        prev_sig=b"prev-signature"
    )
    
    # Serialize to bytes
    serialized = envelope.SerializeToString()
    
    # Compare with golden file
    with open("tests/golden/envelope_v1.bin", "rb") as f:
        golden_bytes = f.read()
    
    assert serialized == golden_bytes
