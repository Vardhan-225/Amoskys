## üî• CRITICAL PATH TO 100%

### Phase 1: Live Data (1-2 hours)
```bash
# Start collecting real telemetry
./amoskys-eventbus &
./amoskys-snmp-agent &

# Wait 1 hour, collect 100+ events
```
**Result:** Real device patterns captured ‚Üí 68%

### Phase 2: ML Integration (2-3 hours)
```bash
# Connect models to live stream
python scripts/connect_ml_to_eventbus.py

# Test real-time inference
python scripts/live_inference.py
```
**Result:** ML models processing live data ‚Üí 75%

### Phase 3: Multi-Device (1-2 hours)
- Add 2-3 network devices to `config/snmp_agent.yaml`
- Deploy ProcAgent
- Test correlation across devices

**Result:** Multi-agent monitoring ‚Üí 80%

### Phase 4: Model Fixes (2-4 hours)
- Fix XGBoost protobuf conflict
- Optimize LSTM architecture
- Ensemble voting implementation

**Result:** All 4 models operational ‚Üí 90%

### Phase 5: Advanced Features (4-8 hours)
- Implement FlowAgent (packet capture)
- Add MQTT collector
- Build forensics tools

**Result:** Full threat detection ‚Üí 100%

**Total Time Estimate:** 10-19 hours to full production

## üö® KNOWN ISSUES

### Issue 1: Protobuf Dependency Conflict
**Problem:** XGBoost requires protobuf v3, AMOSKYS uses v4  
**Impact:** XGBoost training blocked  
**Solution Options:**
1. Use virtualenv isolation
2. Docker containerization
3. Switch to LightGBM alternative

### Issue 2: LSTM Training Too Slow
**Problem:** 30+ minutes training time, process stalled  
**Impact:** LSTM model not available  
**Solution Options:**
1. Reduce model complexity
2. Add GPU support (CUDA)
3. Use pre-trained weights
4. Switch to GRU architecture

### Issue 3: Small Dataset
**Problem:** Only ~100 events in WAL database  
**Impact:** Insufficient training data  
**Solution:** Collect for 24-48 hours, need 1000+ events

### Issue 4: Single Device Monitoring
**Problem:** Only localhost configured  
**Impact:** Can't detect lateral movement or multi-host attacks  
**Solution:** Add network devices to config, deploy to multiple hosts

### Issue 5: No Live Inference
**Problem:** Models trained but not connected to EventBus stream  
**Impact:** Zero real-time threat detection  
**Solution:** Build inference bridge to EventBus (CRITICAL)

## üí° KEY INSIGHTS

### What's Working Exceptionally Well
1. **EventBus Reliability** - Zero crashes, handles high load gracefully
2. **SNMP Collection** - Real device data flowing, cryptographically signed
3. **Feature Engineering** - 106 features exceed 100 target, quality validated
4. **Documentation** - 25+ comprehensive guides, clear roadmaps

### What Needs Urgent Attention
1. **ML Integration Gap** - Models exist but disconnected from live stream
2. **XGBoost Blocked** - Dependency conflict preventing training
3. **LSTM Too Slow** - Architecture needs optimization
4. **Single Device** - Need 10x more data sources

### What's the Bottleneck
**CRITICAL BOTTLENECK:** Real-time ML inference not implemented

The platform has all pieces:
- ‚úÖ Data collection working
- ‚úÖ Feature engineering working
- ‚úÖ Models trained (1 of 4)
- ‚úÖ Correlation engine working

But they're **not connected**. Models are trained on static CSVs, not consuming live EventBus stream.

**Impact:** Zero real-time threat detection despite 65% system operational

**Solution:** Build inference bridge (estimated 2-3 hours)
