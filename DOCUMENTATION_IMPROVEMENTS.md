## Documentation Quality Standards

All new docstrings follow these standards:

### 1. Google Style Format
```python
def function(arg1: type1, arg2: type2) -> return_type:
    """Brief one-line summary.

    Detailed explanation of purpose, behavior, and rationale.
    Can span multiple paragraphs.

    Args:
        arg1: Description of arg1
        arg2: Description of arg2

    Returns:
        Description of return value and semantics

    Raises:
        ExceptionType: When this exception occurs

    Example:
        >>> result = function(value1, value2)
        >>> assert result == expected
    """
```

### 2. Content Requirements

Every docstring includes:
- **One-line summary**: Quick understanding of purpose
- **Detailed description**: What, why, and how
- **Args/Returns/Raises**: Complete parameter documentation
- **Security notes**: Where cryptography or auth is involved
- **Performance notes**: Complexity analysis for critical paths
- **Usage examples**: For complex or non-obvious functions
- **Thread safety**: For concurrent code
- **Future notes**: For incomplete or evolving features

### 3. Focus Areas

Special attention to:
- **Security-critical code**: Signature verification, TLS, authentication
- **Reliability mechanisms**: WAL, retries, idempotency
- **Performance-sensitive paths**: Overload detection, rate limiting
- **Public APIs**: Functions/classes called by other modules
- **Complex algorithms**: Backpressure, deduplication cache

## Impact Analysis

### For Developers

**Before**:
- Reading critical code like `publish_with_wal()` required code analysis
- Understanding retry logic meant tracing through backoff calculations
- Security implications were implicit and undocumented
- New team members faced steep learning curve

**After**:
- Every function explains its purpose immediately
- Retry logic is documented with backoff strategy details
- Security considerations are explicit in docstrings
- New developers can understand the system from documentation alone

### For Operations

**Before**:
- Health endpoint behavior was unclear
- Overload modes were undocumented
- Metrics meaning required source code inspection

**After**:
- Health/readiness semantics clearly documented
- All overload modes explained with use cases
- Every metric has purpose documented in module docstring

### For Security Audits

**Before**:
- Signature verification flow required code tracing
- Canonical form rationale was implicit
- Trust model was undocumented

**After**:
- Complete signature verification flow documented
- Canonical form necessity and security implications explicit
- Trust model and certificate validation clearly explained

---

## Examples of High-Quality Documentation

### Example 1: Complex Algorithm - Idempotency Cache
```python
def _seen(idem_key: str) -> bool:
    """Check if idempotency key has been seen recently.

    Maintains a rolling LRU cache of idempotency keys to detect duplicate
    publishes from retrying agents. Cache size is fixed at 100,000 entries.

    Args:
        idem_key: SHA256 hex string (64 chars) from Envelope.idempotency_key

    Returns:
        bool: True if key was seen before, False if first occurrence

    Performance:
        - Time: O(1) average for lookup and insert
        - Space: O(100k) entries = ~6.4 MB (64 bytes * 100k keys)
        - Eviction: LRU - oldest keys dropped when cache is full

    Thread Safety:
        Not thread-safe. Must be called from single event loop thread.
    """
```

### Example 2: Security-Critical Function - Signature Generation
```python
def sign(sk: ed25519.Ed25519PrivateKey, data: bytes) -> bytes:
    """Create Ed25519 signature over data.

    Produces a deterministic 64-byte signature. Same data always produces
    same signature with the same key (no randomness involved).

    Args:
        sk: Ed25519 private key
        data: Bytes to sign (typically canonical protobuf serialization)

    Returns:
        bytes: 64-byte Ed25519 signature
    """
```

### Example 3: Public API - WAL Drain
```python
def drain(self, publish_fn: Callable[[pb.Envelope], object], limit: int = 1000) -> int:
    """Drain pending envelopes by publishing them via callback.

    Fetches up to `limit` envelopes in FIFO order and attempts to publish
    each via the provided callback. Successfully published envelopes are
    deleted from the WAL.

    Args:
        publish_fn: Callback that publishes envelope and returns PublishAck
        limit: Maximum number of envelopes to drain in one call

    Returns:
        int: Number of envelopes successfully drained and removed from WAL

    Behavior:
        - OK (status=0): Delete from WAL, continue draining
        - RETRY (status=1): Stop draining, leave all remaining in WAL
        - ERROR (status=2,3,...): Delete from WAL, continue draining
        - No status/None: Stop draining (likely RPC failure)

    Example:
        >>> def publish(env):
        ...     return stub.Publish(env, timeout=2.0)
        >>> drained = wal.drain(publish, limit=500)
    """
```
